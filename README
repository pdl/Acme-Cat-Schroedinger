Acme-Cat-Schroedinger

A newly-created Acme::Cat::Schroedinger could be anything. It could be cooperative, and be anything you want it to be. It could be perverse and will never be what you want it to be. Or it could behave like the original Schroedinger's Cat and its behaviour will be, for all intents and purposes, unknowable until you interact with it.
